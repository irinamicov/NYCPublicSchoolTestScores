# Analysing NYC Public School Test Result Scores

## Context

Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardised tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analysing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

In the notebook, I analyse data on SATs across public schools in New York City mainly by generating **summary statistics** and applying **filters**. 

## Project Description

For this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools. Among other things, I looked at how performance varies by borough, identified how many schools fail to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the city!

### Some of the questions answered in this project:

- What are the best math schools with an average math score of at least 80% of the maximum total points?
- Which school has the lowest average reading score?
- Which school has the highest average writing score?
- What are the top 10 schools across the board?
- What NY boroughs have the best performing schools?

The data for this project is available in a single table called `schools` containing details such as the school name, borough, building number, average scores in math, reading and writing, as well as the percentage of students tested.

### Project Tasks:

1. Inspecting the data
2. Finding missing values
3. Schools by building code
4. Best schools for math
5. Lowest reading score
6. Best writing school
7. Top 10 schools
8. Ranking boroughs
9. Brooklyn's best maths schools

The project is completed on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) using **SQL**.
